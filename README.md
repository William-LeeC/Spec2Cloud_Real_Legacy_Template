## What is spec2cloud?

spec2cloud is a spec-driven development framework where **specifications are the single source of truth**. Tests are generated from specs, implementation makes those tests pass, and the result is deployed to Azure — all orchestrated by an AI agent with **46 specialized skills**. Every step is resumable, auditable, and requires human approval before anything ships.

## Why spec2cloud?

- **Specifications are the source of truth** — not code, not comments, not wikis
- **Tests before code** — every feature has tests before implementation begins
- **Human approval at every gate** — nothing ships without your sign-off
- **Resumable from any point** — state persisted in git, pick up where you left off
- **Works for new and existing apps** — greenfield builds new, brownfield modernizes existing

## Two Paths, One Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/two-paths.svg" alt="Greenfield vs Brownfield" width="720" />
</p>

**Greenfield** — Start with a product idea → PRD → FRD → UI → Tests → Contracts → Implementation → Deployed on Azure.

**Brownfield** — Start with existing code → Extract specs → Testability gate → Green baseline or behavioral docs → Assess → Plan → Same delivery pipeline.

Both converge on the same **Phase 2 delivery**: Tests → Contracts → Implementation → Deploy.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Option 1: npx (recommended)
npx spec2cloud init

# Option 2: Quick install script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmeaAppGbb/spec2cloud/vNext/scripts/quick-install.sh | bash

# Option 3: Start from a shell template (new projects)
npx spec2cloud init --list-shells          # See available shells
npx spec2cloud init --shell typescript     # Start with a shell
```

See **[INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md)** for detailed installation options and configuration.
